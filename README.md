# svg-logo-maker
In this project, I wrote the code to allow a user to generate a logo.svg file via prompts in 
terminal. This includes choosing a shape from a list, inputing the color of the logo, the text to be entered on the logo, and the text color. It outputs a new logo.svg file in the examples folder.
